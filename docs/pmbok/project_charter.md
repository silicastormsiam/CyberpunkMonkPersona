# Project Charter: CPM - Chat Bot

## Project Purpose
Develop a Python-based chatbot, *Cyberpunk Monk (CPM)*, to serve as an interactive portal for exploring *SilicaStormSiam* GitHub projects (home automation, cybersecurity, Python tutorials). The chatbot embodies a tech-spiritual persona, hosted locally with future Tor .onion potential, enhancing Andrew Hollandâ€™s portfolio and YouTube presence (@SilicaStormSiam).

## Objectives
- Build a Flask-based chatbot with responses about *SilicaStormSiam* projects.
- Host locally on Windows (Git Bash) or Proxmox VM, accessible via `localhost:5000`.
- Integrate into `SilicaStormSiam/CyberpunkMonkPersona` GitHub repository.
- Track progress in GitHub Projects, aligned with PMBOK process groups.
- Support future Dark Web deployment.

## Stakeholders
- **Project Sponsor**: Andrew Holland (@SilicaStormSiam)
- **Project Manager**: Andrew Holland
- **Team**: Potential collaborators (TBD, via GitHub)
- **End Users**: GitHub visitors, YouTube audience (@SilicaStormSiam), homelab enthusiasts

## Scope
- **In-Scope**: Chatbot development (Python, Flask), local hosting, GitHub integration, basic HTML frontend, PMBOK documentation.
- **Out-of-Scope**: Advanced NLP (e.g., Rasa), .onion deployment (deferred), external API integrations.

## Constraints
- Budget: Minimal (open-source tools, existing homelab).
- Timeline: 4 weeks (start: July 20, 2025; end: August 17, 2025).
- Resources: Single developer (Andrew), Proxmox VM or Windows.

## Risks
