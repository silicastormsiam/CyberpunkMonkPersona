- **Purpose**: Describes the Cyberpunk Monk - CPM Chat Bot, a Flask-based web application for interacting with users about SilicaStormSiam's projects, to be included in the GitHub project documentation.
- **Version Control**:
  - **Version 1.0 (2025-07-21)**: Initial creation of the chatbot description for the CPM - Chat Bot project.
## Overview
The Cyberpunk Monk - CPM Chat Bot is a digital assistant embodying a monk with neural implants, hacking for truth, and guiding users through SilicaStormSiam’s projects in homelab, cybersecurity, and Python development.
## Concept
A blend of cyberpunk aesthetics (#1B0024, #E754AA, #00BF00) and monastic discipline, this persona represents a unique identity for tech innovation by Andrew John Holland.
## Chatbot
The chatbot is implemented as a Flask web application, executed locally by running scripts/monk_bot.py. It serves a web interface (assets/chat.html) for user interaction and responds to queries via the /monk endpoint, offering predefined responses about SilicaStormSiam’s projects.
## PMBOK
The project is structured according to PMBOK guidelines, with documentation in docs/pmbok/ and tracked on the PMBOK Task Board (“SilicaStormSiam Projects”) with columns for Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing phases.
## Setup
Refer to docs/local_setup.md for detailed instructions on setting up the chatbot locally, including requirements (Python 3.11, Flask) and steps to run the server and test the application.
## Example Queries
- **Tell me about GitHub**: Provides information about SilicaStormSiam’s GitHub repository and projects.
- **What’s your homelab?**: Describes the homelab setup, including Proxmox VMs and Home Assistant.
- **Show me your Python projects**: Highlights Python scripts and tutorials available on GitHub and YouTube.
